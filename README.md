# Steam Applications Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This is a data science and analytics project that uses historical Steam application data to build and evaluate machine learning models that predict app prices.  
This project aims to explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation.

### Goals
- Predict prices and evaluate price patterns of Steam apps
- Compare the performance of different ML models
- Provide insights into factors that influence price
